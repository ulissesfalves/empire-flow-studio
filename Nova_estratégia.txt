🔥 SCRIPT 1 publicado em: 26/01/2026

You’re becoming replaceable.
You’re not falling behind.
You’re being standardized.

They turn your job into steps.
Steps into checklists.
Checklists into templates.

Templates don’t need you.
That’s why they ask you to document everything.
Not to help you. To package you.

And once you’re packaged… you’re priced.
You’re not underpaid.
You’re pre-replaced.

They don’t pay loyal employees.
They pay dangerous ones.

Loyal people stay quiet.
Dangerous people leave.

So the system rewards risk.
Not effort. Not dedication.

That’s why your coworker jumps companies.
And you train replacements.

They negotiate. You overperform.
They get raises. You get praise.

🔥 SCRIPT 3 publicado em: 27/01/2026

Working harder doesn’t make you safer.
It makes you cheaper.

Harder workers absorb more.
More tasks. More pressure. More responsibility.

For the same pay. You become a discount solution.
Not a valuable asset.

Assets get protected.
Discounts get exploited.

🔥 SCRIPT 4

Your salary isn’t low by accident.
It’s low by design.

Companies track how little you’ll accept.
Not how much you deserve.

Every time you stay silent…
The number locks in.

Your raise isn’t late.
It’s intentionally small.

🔥 SCRIPT 5

They don’t need you broke.
They need you anxious.

Anxious people don’t plan.
They react.

Reactive people take bad deals.
Bad deals make money.

Stress isn’t a side effect.
It’s the fuel.

🔥 SCRIPT 6

The new hire makes more than you.
Same title. Same workload.

Not because they’re better.
Because they arrived expensive.

You arrived early.
Early workers get discounted.

🔥 SCRIPT 7

Job security didn’t disappear.
It was removed.

Slowly. Quietly.

Through contracts.
Through outsourcing.
Through “flexibility.”

Flexible for them.
Disposable for you.

🔥 SCRIPT 8

They love when you say:
“I’m just grateful to have a job.”

Grateful people don’t negotiate.
Grateful people don’t push back.

Grateful people stay cheap.

Gratitude became a wage control tool.

🔥 SCRIPT 9

Your company isn’t a family.

Families don’t fire you by email.
Families don’t replace you in 48 hours.

You’re a line item.
Line items get cut.

That’s the relationship.

🔥 SCRIPT 10

You think you’re behind.
Behind who?

People who job-hop.
People who negotiate.
People who leave fast.

You were trained to stay.
They were trained to move.

That’s the difference.
